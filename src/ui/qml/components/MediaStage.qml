// Double-buffered still/clip stage shared by Lightbox.qml and OverlayPreview.qml.
//
// The double buffer: `loader` async-decodes `targetUrl` off the UI thread and
// promotes it to `committedUrl` — the source of the visible `still` — only once
// it reaches Image.Ready. The previously committed still stays painted until
// then, so stepping between captures never flashes an empty stage.
//
// Both callers paint a clip's thumbnail on the still layer and let the video
// surface — which sits above it — cover that once the player has a frame, so the
// stage never blanks between captures. They still differ in WHEN the video takes
// over (the Lightbox plays a clip as soon as it is selected, the overlay waits
// for playback to be focused), so those rules are set by the caller; this
// component owns what is identical — the decode-then-promote handoff and the
// player/end-of-media wiring.
