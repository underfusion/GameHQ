// The default skin: near-black cool glass lit from the edges by a soft blue
// bloom, pure white type, and a lot of air. Minimal and clean — no texture,
// nothing drawn that does not carry meaning. Console-dashboard in feel, which
// is what this app is for.
//
// The blues are deliberate rather than sampled: a deep cobalt (#003791) ramping
// into a brighter blue (#0070D1), with a teal edge bloom. The semantic accents
// are borrowed from the same family — a green for success, a magenta-pink for
// danger — chosen to read at a glance against near-black.
//
// Type is Segoe UI: humanist, and present on every Win10/11 box, so it never
// falls back to something unintended.
