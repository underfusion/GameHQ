// Per-window payload-read budget for the "press your button now" probe.
//
// The probe is explicitly requested, lasts three seconds and only ever stores
// changed-bit summaries, so its cost is worth spending on completeness: up to
// kReadsPerSlice reads per kSliceMs — 10 000 reports a second — are read in
// full. A 4 kHz pad (12 000 reports per window) and an 8 kHz pad (24 000) are
// therefore covered report for report, and a 20 ms tap cannot fall into a gap.
//
// Above that rate — several flooding devices at once — the budget switches to
// *evenly strided* sampling: every Nth report, with N recomputed each slice
// from the previous slice's observed rate. Never "read the first N then go
// blind", which is what leaves a tap unseen. The per-slice ceiling is the only
// bound, deliberately: a separate whole-window cap would be spent before the
// end of the window and blind the probe exactly where the user is most likely
// to press. It bounds the window by construction anyway — 10 000 reads per
// second of probe, so 30 000 for the standard three seconds. Any skipped
// report sets sampled(), which the summary surfaces, so a probe that sampled
// never reads as one that saw everything.
