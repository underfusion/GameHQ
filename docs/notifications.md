# Notifications (in-app toasts)

App-wide, reusable toast notifications styled from [design-system.md](design-system.md). Introduced dev.14.

## Behaviour

A toast slides in at the **bottom-right** of the monitor the active app (usually the game) is on, holds for ~2.6 s, then fades out and removes itself. Multiple toasts stack vertically (newest at the bottom, nearest the corner). The host window hides automatically when the stack empties.

The toast window is **frameless, topmost, click-through and non-activating** — posting a toast never pulls focus away from a running game, and clicks pass straight through to whatever is underneath. (Like the overlay, it renders over borderless/windowed games; exclusive-fullscreen is a WGC-era concern.)

## Architecture

- `notify/NotificationCenter` (C++, context property **`notifications`**) — lazy-loads `ToastWindow.qml`, sets the window flags (`FramelessWindowHint | WindowStaysOnTopHint | Tool | WindowDoesNotAcceptFocus | WindowTransparentForInput`), positions it against the work-area corner of the active app's screen, shows it without activating (`SW_SHOWNOACTIVATE`), and emits `posted(title, body, imageUrl, kind)`.
- `ui/qml/ToastWindow.qml` (objectName `gamehqToasts`) — a transparent `Window` holding a `ListModel` + bottom-anchored `Column`/`Repeater`. Appends on `notifications.posted`; each card removes itself via the root `dismissToast(idx)` function; calls `notifications.hideWindow()` when empty.
- `ui/qml/components/Toast.qml` — the card: a `Theme.surface` rounded rectangle with a left **accent bar** coloured by `kind` (`success`→`Theme.success`, `error`→`Theme.danger`, else `Theme.accent`), an optional 16:9 thumbnail, a title (`fontH3`, DemiBold) and body (`fontCaption`, muted). Slide-in + fade on entry, fade on exit, `lifespan` timer (default 2600 ms).

## Posting one

```cpp
notifications->post(title, body, imagePath /* "" = text only */, kind /* success|info|error */);
```

Any subsystem can post. Currently wired: **screenshot saved** → `post("Screenshot saved", <game>, <png path>, "success")` (replaces the old OS tray balloon; gated by `notifications.enabled`, default true).

> QML note: a `Repeater` delegate that is a separate component type cannot reliably resolve a *sibling* `id` (e.g. the `ListModel`) from inside its signal handlers under the QML AOT cache — route such access through a function on the **root** object instead (the root `id` always resolves).
