# Database (SQLite)

Game display names are de-duplicated against their folder-safe form on startup and insert. `GameRowRepair` owns startup duplicate merging, and insert-time matching reuses the same display-name preference rule. This prevents managed-captures rescans from creating a second game row when a real title contains Windows-forbidden path characters, e.g. `The First Berserker: Khazan` saved on disk as `The First Berserker_ Khazan`.

When GameHQ detects a foreground game or saves a GameHQ-created screenshot/replay from one, `games.executable_path` is updated if Windows exposes the executable path, and `GameIconCache` caches the Windows file icon as a PNG in `gamehq-data/game-icons/`. `AppController::games()` exposes that `icon_path` as `iconPath`; `CurrentGameService` also uses `executable_path` to keep the dynamic `Game` section attached to a captured game while that executable is still running, even if GameHQ or the overlay has foreground focus. Imported/rescanned captures without an executable path simply keep a text-only game row until the same game is detected in the foreground. `GameMetadataBackfill` can repair older rows from historical `gamehq.log` detector lines at startup.

If an older row is missing executable/icon metadata, startup also checks prior `GameDetector` lines in `gamehq.log` and backfills matching game rows from those historical detections. This lets rows that existed before icon caching recover an icon without requiring a new capture or another foreground poll first.

Existing v1 databases are repaired on startup with compatibility `ALTER TABLE` checks for `games.executable_path`, `games.icon_path`, and `games.last_seen_at`; the schema version stays at v1 because these columns are treated as v1-compatible metadata fields.

File: `gamehq-data/gamehq.db`. Access via Qt SQL (`QSQLITE`) from the app/controller/model paths. Keep queries short on the UI path; larger repair work should stay in helpers such as `GameMetadataBackfill` and `GameRowRepair`. Schema versioned with `PRAGMA user_version`; migrations run in `CaptureDatabase::migrate()` — one numbered step per schema change, never edit past migrations. The startup repair pass (brand paths, duplicate collapse, path renormalization, game-row/metadata repair) runs inside a single transaction so a mid-run crash cannot leave the library half-repaired. The two heavy one-time passes — `GameRowRepair::normalizeDuplicateNames` (O(n²) display-name scan) and `GameMetadataBackfill::run` (full `gamehq.log` rescan) — are gated behind the `internal.repairs_v1_done` sentinel in the `settings` table: they run once after an upgrade and skip on every later launch. The sentinel is written inside the same repair transaction, so it only persists if those repairs commit.

`CaptureDatabase` is the public storage facade for callers. Read-only capture/game listing and boolean lookup SQL lives in `CaptureQueries`; mutations, migrations, and insert-time game resolution stay in `CaptureDatabase`.

  process_name   TEXT,
  window_title   TEXT,
  created_at     TEXT NOT NULL,            -- ISO 8601 UTC
  duration_ms    INTEGER,
  width          INTEGER, height INTEGER, fps INTEGER,
  codec          TEXT, bitrate INTEGER,

  event_name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  enabled    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  volume     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 80,
  sound_file TEXT
);
```

## Schema v2

```sql
CREATE TABLE binding_overrides (
  id             INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  device_group   TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(device_group IN ('keyboard','controller','mouse')),
  device_profile TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',   -- device family/fingerprint scope; '' = every device in the group
  action_id      TEXT NOT NULL,               -- ActionCatalog id, e.g. "global.screenshot"
  slot           INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1 CHECK(slot IN (1,2)),  -- 1 = primary, 2 = secondary
  trigger_code   TEXT,                        -- canonical control id or key chord; NULL when unbound
  activation     TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'press' CHECK(activation IN ('press','tap','hold','double_tap')),
  hold_ms        INTEGER,
  unbound        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 CHECK(unbound IN (0,1))
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_binding_overrides_scope
  ON binding_overrides(device_group, device_profile, action_id, slot);
```

Built-in trigger defaults live in `src/input/BindingResolver`, never in the database. `binding_overrides` only holds explicit user changes — one row per (device group, device profile, action, slot) — so an empty table means every action uses its code-side default. Schema v3 widens `device_group` to include safe extra mouse buttons. The legacy v1 `bindings` table remains untouched and is superseded by `binding_overrides`; its seeded rows represented defaults rather than user choices and are not migrated.

## Hard rules

- **Favorites (`is_favorite = 1`) are never auto-deleted** — cleanup queries must always include `AND is_favorite = 0`.
- Deletes from GameHQ UI are soft (`deleted_at`) first; file removal is a separate confirmed step.
- Imported folders' files are never modified/deleted unless the user explicitly enables it.
