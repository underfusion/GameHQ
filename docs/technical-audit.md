# Technical Audit

Date: 2026-07-16. Scope: full codebase - C++ service layer, QML, config, storage,
capture/replay, input, docs, and test coverage.

This audit supersedes the 2026-07-09 pass. That earlier audit's findings all
landed; they are summarized under [Prior Wave](#prior-wave-2026-07-09) rather
than repeated as open items.

## Current Shape

GameHQ is a Qt/QML Windows app with a native C++ service layer:

- `App` wires lifetime and signals for config, database, scanner, galleries,
  screenshots, replay frame pump, overlay, notifications, input, sounds, tray,
  and QML context properties.
- `AppController` is the single QML bridge. It owns QML-facing filter state and
  folder commands while delegating capture-library work (`CaptureLibraryService`),
  current-game lookup (`CurrentGameService`), non-plain config keys
  (`SettingsRouter`), and shell actions (`ShellActions`).
- `GalleryModel` is a thin `QAbstractListModel` over
  `CaptureDatabase::listCaptures(category, gameId)`.
- `CaptureDatabase` owns the storage facade, schema/migrations, and mutations.
  Read queries live in `CaptureQueries`; icon extraction, log backfill, and
  duplicate-row repair live in `GameIconCache`, `GameMetadataBackfill`, and
  `GameRowRepair`.
- `GameDetector` resolves the foreground window, process path, likely game title,
  fullscreen heuristic, and capture gate. The disk-backed title sources (Steam
  `.acf` scan, version-resource reads) are memoized per foreground process, keyed
  by pid and path; the window caption stays live per tick.
- `ScreenshotService` handles one-shot GDI screenshots and async PNG writes.
- `FramePumpService` handles always-on WGC replay capture on a dedicated MTA
  worker thread, rolling H.264/AAC segments, and replay export.
- `OverlayManager` owns lazy overlay QML loading, topmost window placement,
  foreground stealing, and focus restoration.
- `InputEngine` routes controller input between global actions, overlay, and
  desktop gallery, dispatching through a static action table.

The responsibility drift the 2026-07-09 audit called out is largely resolved.
The remaining large units are concentrated in two places that are deliberately
left alone: the replay pipeline and the controller backends. Both were tuned and
hand-verified against real games and real hardware, and neither can be safely
restructured without a live re-verification session.

## Findings

### P0 - No Blocker Found

The tree builds and runs. No compile-time or startup blocker was found during
this audit.

### P1 - Startup Cost Paid on Every Launch - Fixed

`GameMetadataBackfill::run()` (full log scan) and
`GameRowRepair::normalizeDuplicateNames()` (O(n^2) games scan) ran on every
launch forever, and `CaptureScanner::scanFolder` issued two DB round-trips per
file during its directory walk.

Landed: both repair passes are gated behind a `repairs_v1` completion sentinel
(`CaptureDatabase::repairsV1Done()`), so they run once and then skip. Capture
lookups are batched into one `CaptureQueries::captureIndex()` snapshot that the
scan diffs in memory.

### P1 - Startup Repair Was Not Atomic - Fixed

The brand-rename / duplicate-collapse / path-renormalization block in
`CaptureDatabase::migrate()` ran as separate auto-commit statements, so a
mid-run crash left partial repairs behind.

Landed: the whole repair region runs in one transaction with rollback.

### P1 - Config Keys Were Bare Strings - Fixed

About 30 `config.json` keys were spelled as string literals across 14 C++ files,
where a typo silently falls back to the default instead of failing.

Landed: `src/config/ConfigKeys.h` declares each key once as a
`constexpr QLatin1StringView`; every C++ call site now goes through it. QML keeps
using string literals - it has no access to the constants. The page ->
config-group reset taxonomy moved to `SettingsCategories`.

### P1 - Duplicated Capture Helpers, One With a Latent Bug - Fixed

The capture modules each carried their own HRESULT logger, timestamped-filename
builder, and QPC conversion. `AudioCapture`'s naive multiply was a latent
A/V-sync overflow; `FramePumpService` already had the overflow-safe formula.

Landed: `src/capture/CaptureUtil.h` holds one `ok()` logger, one overflow-safe
`qpcNow100ns()`, the stale-segment threshold constant, and the shared filename
builder. The audio clock overflow is gone. Live A/V-sync re-verification is still
outstanding - see the deferred register.

### P2 - QML Duplication Against a Now-Complete Token Set

The `Theme.qml` token set had real gaps (`borderHairline`, `radiusXS`, spacing
steps, letter-spacing), and QML worked around them with hex colors, 20 `Qt.rgba`
literals, and hardcoded font sizes. Several components were triplicated.

Landed: 16 tokens added and the literals swept through `Theme`; `VideoBadge.qml`
replaces three inline copies of the play badge; `SettingsPathField.qml` replaces
two copies of the read-only path box; `SidebarCategories.js` grew a
`resolveFilter()` that all three sidebar dispatch blocks now share.

Not done deliberately: the two settings pages still use different divider tokens
(`Theme.borderLight` vs `Theme.stroke`). Picking one is a visual decision, not a
cleanup - it needs a call, not a refactor.

### P2 - Dead Input Code - Fixed

`TapHoldDetector.{h,cpp}` had zero references, and `Gamepad` carried legacy
`buttonPressed/buttonReleased(int)` signals plus an inert `legacyButton`
parameter threaded through all four backends.

Landed: all removed. `controlIdFor`/`buttonName` stay - they do real translation.

### P2 - Legacy Shims Inlined in Startup - Fixed

The PlayHQ/SavePlay lockfile/DB/folder rename compatibility block was inlined in
`App::init`.

Landed: extracted to `config/LegacyMigration`. `App::init` now uses
`Paths::databasePath()` and documents its construct-before-connect ordering
contract.

### P2 - No Automated Tests - Fixed (First Slice)

The project relied entirely on build/run/log verification and real hardware
tests. That is unavoidable for WGC, controller, and overlay behavior, but not for
pure logic.

Landed: an opt-in `tests/` target (QtTest + CTest, `-DGAMEHQ_BUILD_TESTS=ON`) with
51 assertions across `tst_gameidentity` (25), `tst_configmanager` (16), and
`tst_gamerowrepair` (10). Runs in about 0.1 s; command documented in
[dev-setup.md](dev-setup.md). Scope is pure logic only - no DB, no GUI, no game
process. `CaptureScanner::inferGameName` moved to `GameIdentity::inferFromPath`
as the testing seam, which also removed a duplicated "Unknown Game" fallback.

The rule going forward: if a unit needs half the app to build, it is not pure
logic and does not belong in this target.

## Deferred Register

Nothing here is abandoned. Each entry records why it is not closed and what would
close it.

### Code Complete, Awaiting Human Verification

These landed on `dev` and build clean. The agent that wrote them cannot perform
the verification their acceptance requires, so they are held rather than claimed.

| Area | Committed | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Capture shared utilities | 0.5.59 | Live-game replay with audio ON; confirm A/V sync after the clock-overflow fix |
| AppController config special-casing (`SettingsRouter`) | 0.5.64 | Roughly 2-minute Settings-UI check: change a capture root, toggle startup, reset a group |
| Table-driven `InputEngine::dispatchAction` | 0.5.66 | Keyboard + pad smoke: screenshot, overlay toggle, replay save, D-pad/L1/R1 hold-to-repeat |
| Theme tokens and literal sweep | 0.5.67 | Visual spot-check of gallery, overlay, settings, toasts |
| Unified sidebar filter-select | 0.5.69 | Mandatory pad check - sits on the hand-verified DualSense path |
| Cached `GameDetector` title resolution | 0.5.73 | Live game: Steam title path, codename/exe fallback path, a game switch, and auto-arm still catching a fullscreen game |
| `BulkSelection.qml` state-machine extraction | 0.5.74 | Bulk mode: shift-click a range, then shift-click back over it — it must undo, not leave a trail; plus the pad flow |
| Capture god-function split (`startPump`, `saveReplayOnWorker`, `remuxConcatImpl`, `buildWriter`) | 0.5.93 | Live game: replay buffer arms, 5 s segment rolls without hitching, Share-hold saves a playable clip with correct duration/audio, and a second save while one is exporting is refused cleanly |
| `DualSenseDevice::parseReport` split | 0.5.94 | Pad in hand: DualSense over USB and BT — D-pad and left-stick nav (no doubled events at the deadzone boundary), face buttons, Share-hold replay save, and a DSX/second-pad failover if available |

### Deliberately Out of Scope for This Wave

High-risk rework of code that was tuned against real games and real hardware. The
common thread: each needs a live re-verification session that a code-only pass
cannot provide, so each should ride along with feature work that already forces
that testing.

- **Split the capture god-functions** — landed in 0.5.93 as a structure-only
  split (literal transcription into phase helpers, no behavior change intended):
  `startPump` → createDevices/createCaptureItem/attachRecorder/createSession,
  `saveReplayOnWorker` → saveGuard/freezeRing/instantThumbnail/runExport,
  `remuxConcatImpl` → openSegment/beginConcatWriter/copySamples (the duplicated
  video/audio copy loops unified), `buildWriter` →
  createSegmentSink/addVideoStream/addAudioStream. Still needs the multi-title
  live re-verification above before it counts as verified.
- **Split `DualSenseDevice::parseReport`** — landed in 0.5.94 as a
  structure-only split (literal transcription): buttonBlockBase (USB/BT/DS4
  offset table) → decodeButtons → decodeStickNav (hysteresis unchanged) →
  routeReport (active-pad selection/steal). Needs the pad re-verification above.
- **Unify stick deadzone hysteresis across backends.** Still deferred: unifying
  deadzones changes nav feel on XInput/WinMM pads and needs a real-hardware
  matrix (DualSense, DSX virtual, XInput pad).
- **Decouple `DesktopGalleryGrid` from its `host`.** The remaining half of the
  bulk-selection item (0.5.74 landed the state-machine extraction). Deferred: the
  coupling carries pad nav-lock timing that needs a DualSense in hand.

### Reassessed and implemented as a parameterized stage (0.5.95)

- **Shared `MediaStage.qml` for Lightbox/OverlayPreview.** The 2026-07-16 pass
  recommended dropping this: the two surfaces share a widget tree, not behavior.
  On the video path they do opposite things — Lightbox leaves the still layer
  empty and lets `VideoOutput` cover the stage, while `OverlayPreview` paints the
  clip's *thumbnail* there until `videoFocused` flips. `OverlayPreview` also
  tracks a committed-vs-requested frame index, carries a `_modelRevision`
  dependency, and clears state on an empty source; Lightbox commits eagerly in
  `openAt()` and has no equivalent.

  Built anyway in 0.5.95 at the owner's direction, with the divergence made
  explicit rather than hidden. `components/MediaStage.qml` owns only what is
  identical — the async decode-then-promote handoff and the player/end-of-media
  wiring — and every rule that differs is a property set by the caller
  (`targetUrl`, `stillVisible`, `videoSource`, `videoVisible`). Two of those
  properties are behavior flags that exist purely to tell the surfaces apart and
  are the main cost of the unification:

  - `clearOnEmptyTarget` — ON for the overlay, OFF for the Lightbox. The Lightbox
    blanks `targetUrl` for *every* clip, so clearing the committed still there
    would make the next image step decode against an empty stage. That is the
    exact flash the double buffer exists to prevent, and it is why the two
    surfaces cannot share one clear-on-empty rule.
  - `stopOnEmptySource` — ON for the Lightbox only; the overlay leaves the player
    alone and re-sources it when playback is focused.

  Index tracking and the revision dependency stayed at the overlay call site
  (`onCommitted`/`onCleared` signals) rather than moving into the component.

## Prior Wave (2026-07-09)

The earlier audit's four phases all landed and are no longer open items:

1. **Low-risk extraction.** `core/GameIdentity` centralized folder-safe names and
   identity keys, replacing duplicated `folderSafeGameKey`/`sanitizeFolder` call
   sites; `hasCapturesForGame()` replaced `listCaptures(...).isEmpty()` existence
   checks; `SidebarCategories.js` unified sidebar category definitions.
2. **AppController facade cleanup.** `ShellActions`, `CaptureLibraryService`, and
   `CurrentGameService` moved work behind a stable QML API.
3. **Database boundary cleanup.** `GameIconCache`, `GameMetadataBackfill`,
   `GameRowRepair`, and `CaptureQueries` left `CaptureDatabase` as mostly SQL and
   migrations.
4. **QML decomposition.** Desktop and overlay chrome componentized; the action
   menu is shared.

The documentation drift that audit recorded (`database.md`, `storage.md`,
`capture-engine.md`, `architecture.md` describing classes that never existed) was
corrected at the time. `Main.qml` is now 726 lines, down from about 1,391;
`OverlayWindow.qml` is 406, down from about 911.

## Direction

Keep public QML and C++ APIs stable. Do not open a broad rewrite - the remaining
large units are large because they are verified, and the cost of re-verifying
them is the real constraint, not the code.

Concretely:

1. Close the seven verification gates above; they are cheap and they unblock
   nothing else, but they are honest debt.
2. Keep every `config.json` key in `ConfigKeys.h`, folder-safe names in
   `GameIdentity`, sidebar category rules in `SidebarCategories.js`, and visual
   values in `Theme.qml`.
3. Grow `tests/` opportunistically - when a pure-logic helper appears, cover it.
4. Let the deferred capture/input splits ride along with feature work that
   already requires live testing.
