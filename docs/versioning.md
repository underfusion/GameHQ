# Versioning & Documentation Rules

> **Project rule (non-negotiable):** every change to the app bumps the version and updates the changelog and any affected docs in the same change.

## Scheme

GameHQ uses Semantic Versioning as plain `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- `MAJOR` - `1.0` is the first polished release; later major bumps are for breaking data/config format changes.
- `MINOR` - active development line or roadmap milestone family.
- `PATCH` - every project change increments this number.

Current development line: `0.6.x`.

Patch numbers run from `0` to `99` within a minor line. After `0.5.99`, the next version is `0.6.0`. The first version after the old `0.1.0-dev.N` scheme is `0.5.0`; the next changed build is `0.5.1`.

The single source of truth is the `VERSION` file in the repo root. CMake reads it and injects `GAMEHQ_VERSION` into the binary; the About/sidebar version label and logs display it. `VERSION` is registered as a CMake configure dependency, so incremental builds reconfigure when the file changes.

## Release Checklist

1. Bump `VERSION` by one patch number (`0.6.10`, `0.6.11`, ...). Roll `0.6.99` to `0.7.0`.
2. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry with Added/Changed/Fixed/Removed sections as needed.
3. Update affected docs in `docs/` when code changes behavior, architecture, storage, setup, capture, overlay, input, or UI rules.
4. Update `docs/README.md` if a doc is added, renamed, or its purpose changes.
5. Update the roadmap or subsystem documentation when scope or behavior changes.
6. Database schema change? Add a migration and bump `PRAGMA user_version`; see [database.md](database.md).

## Changelog Format

[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/): one `## [x.y.z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section per version, newest on top.
