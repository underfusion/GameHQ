## Highlights

- **Save recent gameplay after it happens** — the rolling buffer turns the
  previous configurable minutes into a normal MP4 with system audio.
- **Instant screenshots and frame capture** — save PNG or JPEG images, including
  the exact displayed frame from a recorded clip.
- **In-game gallery** — browse, play, favorite, reveal, and delete captures
  without leaving your game.
- **Controller-first controls** — DualSense, XInput, keyboard, and mouse support
- **Modern controller support** — app-local GameInput, true Share/Guide, extra buttons, and safe legacy fallback ([getting started](docs/getting-started.md), [compatibility guide](docs/controller-compatibility.md))
  with fully configurable bindings.
- **One organized library** — GameHQ captures alongside watched Steam, Game Bar,
  NVIDIA, and OBS folders.
- **Private and portable** — no account, telemetry, background service, or
  game-process injection.
- Configurable replay duration, quality, frame rate, and resolution.
- Primary and secondary bindings with tap, hold, double-tap, conflict handling,
  per-controller profiles, and restore controls.
- Detection of Sony controllers hidden by HidHide, with safe GameHQ allow-list
  setup.
- Thirteen themes, live theme switching, textured backdrops, and adjustable
  overlay dimming.
- Thumbnail zoom and controller-friendly bulk selection in the capture library.
- Immediate gallery refresh after new captures and clean overlay focus handling.

## Installation

**Setup** is recommended for normal use. **Portable ZIP** stores its profile
beside the application and can run from any folder.

Using Playnite? Install the
[GameHQ Integration](https://github.com/underfusion/GameHQ/releases/download/playnite-v0.4.12/GameHQ_Playnite_Integration_0_4_12.pext)
by opening the downloaded `.pext` file with Playnite.

> **Unsigned Beta:** Windows may show an Unknown publisher warning. Download
> GameHQ only from this repository and do not disable Windows Security.

<details>
<summary><strong>Portable, installed, and uninstall behavior</strong></summary>

Portable keeps its profile and default captures beside the extracted app.
Installed mode uses the current user's AppData and `Videos\GameHQ`. On a fresh,
empty installed profile, **Settings > Advanced > Portable profile** can import
an existing portable configuration and library. The importer leaves the
portable source and all capture media in place; populated installed libraries
are not merged.

Uninstall removes only installed program files, shortcuts, and registry values
still owned by that installation. It does not remove AppData, captures, watched
folders, portable copies, or media.

<details>
<summary><strong>Download verification and code signing</strong></summary>

Verify the official source and published release hash before running an
artifact. A specific Defender malware or PUA detection is different from an
Unknown publisher warning: do not bypass it or disable Windows Security. See
[Download verification](docs/download-verification.md) and
[Security & privacy](docs/security-and-privacy.md).

GameHQ's [Code signing policy](docs/code-signing-policy.md) defines release
roles, signed-file scope, manual approval, and verification. Current Beta
downloads remain unsigned.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Building from source</strong></summary>

GameHQ uses C++20, Qt 6.8.3/QML, CMake, Ninja, SQLite, Windows Graphics Capture,
Media Foundation, WASAPI, and Windows input APIs.

See [Development Setup](docs/dev-setup.md) for the toolchain and
[Packaging & Distribution](docs/packaging.md) for the portable package layout.
